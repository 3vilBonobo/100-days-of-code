# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 22, 2021 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I created the basic HTML structure and added some CSS of a tip-calculator app that I'm making as part of the Frontend Mentor Challenges. 

**Thoughts:** I need to be sure that I'm using the correct HTML elements with the correct semantic meaning so I'm doing some extra research on <form>, <input>, <output> and <label> tags.
