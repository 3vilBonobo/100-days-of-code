**Today's Progress**: I created the basic HTML structure and added some CSS of a tip-calculator app that I'm making as part of the Frontend Mentor Challenges.

**Thoughts:** I need to be sure that I'm using the correct HTML elements with the correct semantic meaning so I'm doing some extra research on <form>, <input>, <output> and <label> tags.

**Today's Progress**: I added some extra CSS for my tip calculator, trying to align items correctly.

**Thoughts:** I need to make sure that I'm choosing the correct margin/padding properties to each item and also take under consideration which elements will be handled as block and which as inline.
