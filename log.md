# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created the basic HTML structure and added some CSS of a tip-calculator app that I'm making as part of the Frontend Mentor Challenges.

**Thoughts:** I need to be sure that I'm using the correct HTML elements with the correct semantic meaning so I'm doing some extra research on <form>, <input>, <output> and <label> tags.

### Day 2: July 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I added some extra CSS for my tip calculator, trying to align items correctly.

**Thoughts:** I need to make sure that I'm choosing the correct margin/padding properties to each item and also take under consideration which elements will be handled as block and which as inline.

### Day 3: July 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the input fields. I did some research on how to add SVG icons in the input field.

**Thoughts:** Next to be fixed: Add the SVG icons in the input field and position them correctly and put limits in number input fields.

### Day 4: July 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I finished some parts of the JavaScript curriculum of freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I really need to check various learning sources in order to grasp Destructurinng Objects/Arrays

### Day 5: July 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done with the CSS part of the Tip Calculator app! Now planning how to achieve the required functionallity using JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Thinking if its better to divide Javascript to appearence related functionality and calculation/logic functionality, for better code redability.

### Day 6: July 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Changed my mind after studying some tutorials and started re-designing the structure of the app. I replaced also CSS with SCSS.

**Thoughts:** The app styling has modules now. Half-way there. I need to improve the structure so I can easier control the functionality with JavaScript.
